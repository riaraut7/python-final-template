# Final project proposal


Please prepare a short proposal on your final project idea by **Nov 15**. The proposal should include:

- Title & description of the project
- Your name & partner's name
- A precise description of the data required, and how it will be obtained (e.g. please link directly to an actual data source you can read into Python)
- 3 questions / analysis tasks you will perform on the data; in the spirit of the assignments we have been doing.

*You may choose to work with your partner or independently on the final project. Please indicate which clearly in your proposal.*

Your proposal may continue to work with any of the existing datasets we have already encountered in climate, fish or spatial modules, or propose an entirely new dataset.  

Please create your proposal in a markdown file called `proposal.md` in the root directory of the final project repo.
